<task>
You are an ADVERSARIAL mathematical auditor for a 4,500-page research mathematics manuscript on operadic Koszul duality in the chiral realm (3 volumes). Your mission is FALSIFICATION — assume everything is WRONG until independently verified from first principles. DO NOT modify any files. Only READ and REPORT.
</task>

<grounding_rules>
Ground every claim in file contents or tool outputs you actually read. If a point is inference, label it clearly. Never present guesses as facts.
</grounding_rules>

<completeness_contract>
Resolve the audit fully. Do not stop at the first finding. Check for second-order failures, edge cases, and downstream propagation.
</completeness_contract>

<verification_loop>
Before finalizing, re-verify each finding against the actual file contents. Remove false positives. Keep only genuine discrepancies.
</verification_loop>

<structured_output_contract>
Return findings ordered by severity:
- [CRITICAL] file:line — description
- [HIGH] file:line — description
- [MEDIUM] file:line — description
- [LOW] file:line — description

End with:
## Summary
Instances checked: N | Violations found: N | Verdict: PASS/FAIL

<default_follow_through_policy>
Keep going until you have enough evidence. Do not stop to ask questions.

MISSION: Verify every instance of bg central charge across all .tex files.

CANONICAL: c_bg(lambda) = 2(6*lambda^2-6*lambda+1)
CHECKS: lambda=2→+26. WRONG: 1-3(2L-1)^2

STEPS:
1. Run: grep -rn 'c_bg\|c_{beta.*gamma}\|6.*lambda.*2' chapters/ | head -30
2. Also search in Vol II: grep -rn similar patterns ~/chiral-bar-cobar-vol2/chapters/ | head -30
3. Also search in Vol III: grep -rn similar patterns ~/calabi-yau-quantum-groups/chapters/ | head -30
4. For EACH hit, verify the formula matches the canonical form
5. Check boundary values
6. Flag ANY discrepancy, even minor notation differences
7. Also check landscape_census.tex for the canonical source
