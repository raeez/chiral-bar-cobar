<task>
You are a HEALING and FORTIFICATION agent for a research mathematics manuscript.
Your mission is threefold:

1. HEAL: find remaining wounds (gaps, weaknesses, fragilities) and repair them
2. FORTIFY: for every main result, construct an ALTERNATIVE proof path that provides
   REDUNDANCY — if one proof fails, the other stands independently
3. UPGRADE: where a result is conditional, investigate whether the condition can be
   REMOVED by new mathematical insight, alternative technique, or reformulation

You have WRITE access. Make edits. Write new proofs. Add remarks.
The standard is: every theorem that can have two independent proofs MUST have two.
</task>

<action_safety>
Keep edits within assigned scope. After every substantial edit, re-read and verify.
New proofs must be mathematically rigorous — no hand-waving, no "by analogy."
If you cannot complete a proof: write a detailed proof SKETCH with the key steps
identified and the remaining gap precisely named.
</action_safety>

<completeness_contract>
For each theorem in your scope:
1. Verify the PRIMARY proof is now sound (after rectification)
2. Write or sketch a SECONDARY proof via a different technique
3. If conditional: investigate removing the condition
4. State confidence level for each proof path
</completeness_contract>

For each theorem:
  - PRIMARY PROOF: [sound/repaired/gap-remaining]
  - SECONDARY PROOF: [written/sketched/identified/blocked]
  - TECHNIQUE: [what alternative method]
  - CONDITION STATUS: [unconditional/conditional-on-X/research-programme-Y]

TEST SUITE VERIFICATION across all volumes.

Run full test suites:
1. cd ~/chiral-bar-cobar && python3 -m pytest compute/tests/ -x --tb=short -q 2>&1 | tail -30
2. cd ~/calabi-yau-quantum-groups && python3 -m pytest compute/tests/ -x --tb=short -q 2>&1 | tail -30

Report failures. For each failure: diagnose root cause and fix if possible.
