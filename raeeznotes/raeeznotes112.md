  The three-layer answer

  Layer 1: The constrained Epstein zeta IS a zeta function

  The sharpest proved contact is the fundamental identity for the c=1 self-dual lattice VOA:

  $$\varepsilon^1_s(R{=}1) = 4,\zeta(2s)$$

  The constrained Epstein zeta $\varepsilon^c_s(A) = \sum_{\Delta \in S}(2\Delta)^{-s}$ — summed over scalar primary dimensions with multiplicity — literally is the Riemann zeta function for the simplest
  chiral algebra. The primary spectrum of V_Z at the self-dual radius reproduces $\zeta$ directly.

  More generally (thm:shadow-spectral-correspondence), for any even lattice VOA $V_\Lambda$ of rank $r$ with theta function $\Theta_\Lambda = c_E \cdot E_{r/2} + \sum_j c_j f_j$ (Hecke decomposition into
  Eisenstein + cusp forms):

  $$\varepsilon^r_s(V_\Lambda) = 2^{-s}\Bigl(c_E \cdot C_E(s)\cdot\zeta(s)\cdot\zeta(s{-}r/2{+}1) ;+; \sum_j c_j \cdot C_j(s) \cdot L(s,f_j)\Bigr)$$

  Each independent Hecke eigenform contributes one L-function factor. The shadow depth counts the number of independent L-functions: depth $d \to d-1$ critical lines. This is verified for V_Z (1 line),
  V_{E_8} (2 lines: $\zeta(s)\zeta(s-3)$), V_{Leech} (3 lines: $\zeta(s)\zeta(s-11)L(s,\Delta_{12})$, where $\Delta_{12}$ is the Ramanujan cusp form).

  Layer 2: How zeta zeros enter — the Benjamin-Chang mechanism

  The partition function $\hat{Z}^c(\tau) = y^{c/2}|\eta|^{2c}Z(\tau)$ decomposes spectrally on $\mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{Z})\backslash\mathbb{H}$ via Roelcke-Selberg:

  $$\hat{Z}^c = E_{c/2} + (\text{const})\cdot\varepsilon^c_{c/2-1} + \frac{1}{4\pi i}\int_{1/2-i\infty}^{1/2+i\infty} \pi^{s-c/2}\Gamma(c/2-s),\varepsilon^c_{c/2-s},E_s(\tau),ds ;+; (\text{Maass})$$

  The functional equation for $\varepsilon^c$ involves the factor $\zeta(2s)/\zeta(2s-1)$. Contour deformation picks up residues at $s = (1+\rho)/2$ where $\rho$ are nontrivial zeta zeros (from
  $\zeta(2s-1) = 0$). The scattering matrix $\varphi(s) = \Lambda(1-s)/\Lambda(s)$ on the moduli space $\mathcal{M}_{1,1}$ has poles at exactly $s = \rho/2$.

  The zeta zeros are the scattering resonances of the Laplacian on $\mathcal{M}_{1,1}$, and the chiral algebra's partition function couples to them through its Eisenstein spectral coefficient
  $\varepsilon^c_s$.

  Layer 3: What in the chiral algebra theory constrains these zeros

  The shadow Postnikov tower $\Theta_A^{\leq r}$ — the finite-order projections of the MC element $\Theta_A := D_A - d_0$ — constrains $\varepsilon^c_s$ through the following chain:

  1. The MC equation $D\cdot\Theta + \tfrac{1}{2}[\Theta,\Theta] = 0$ at arity $r$ determines the shadow $\mathrm{Sh}_r(A)$.
  2. The shadow at arity $r$ decomposes into Hecke eigenspaces: $\mathrm{Sh}r(V\Lambda) = \sum_j \alpha_j \cdot a_{f_j}^{r-1}$ where $a_{f_j}$ are Hecke eigenvalues.
  3. The Mellin transform (Approach A, proved for lattice VOAs) sends shadow data $\to$ Hecke decomposition $\to$ L-function analytic continuation $\to$ zeros in the complex plane.

  For the Virasoro algebra (depth $\infty$, class M), the shadow tower gives:
  - $\kappa = c/2$ (arity 2, determines $\zeta$ content)
  - $\alpha_3 = 0$ (cubic vanishing — parity constraint on spectral moments)
  - $Q^{\text{contact}} = 10/[c(5c+22)]$ (quartic — pins down the 4th spectral moment exactly)
  - Infinite tower of higher moments, each a specific rational function of $c$

  These are infinitely many conditions on $\varepsilon^c_s$, and hence on the coupling between the partition function and the scattering matrix.

  The candidate objects

  The most honest answer to your question — "what in the chiral algebra theory could reproduce the spectral structure of the zeta zeros" — is that there are four candidate mechanisms, in decreasing order
  of mathematical substance:

  1. The Hecke-equivariant graph amplitudes $\ell_\Gamma^{(g)}(A)$ in the modular convolution algebra $\mathfrak{g}^{\text{mod}}A$. For lattice VOAs, these factor through Hecke operators $T_n :
  M{r/2}(\Gamma) \to M_{r/2}(\Gamma)$, and their Mellin transforms are literally the L-functions whose zeros are the "spectral structure." The shadow depth controls which Hecke eigenspaces are activated.
  This is proved (Approach A of the spectral continuation programme).

  2. The sewing Fredholm determinant $\det(1 - K_q)$. Its log expansion gives $-\sum \sigma_{-1}(N)q^N$, and the Dirichlet series $\sum \sigma_{-1}(N)N^{-s} = \zeta(s)\zeta(s+1)$ is an Euler product over
  primes. More precisely, the Sewing-Selberg formula gives:

  $$\int_{\mathcal{M}_{1,1}} \log\det(1-K(\tau)) \cdot E_s(\tau),d\mu = -2(2\pi)^{-(s-1)}\Gamma(s-1)\zeta(s-1)\zeta(s)$$

  The sewing operator, integrated against the Eisenstein series over moduli, produces $\zeta(s-1)\zeta(s)$. The zeta zeros are encoded in the spectral theory of sewing over moduli.

  3. The shadow spectral measure $\rho(\lambda)$ from the MC element. For Virasoro at central charge $c$, the generating function $G(t) = -\log(1 + 6t/c)$ analytically continues to
  $\mathbb{C}\setminus{-c/6}$, and the shadow coefficients $S_r$ are moments of this measure. Carleman's condition is satisfied, so the moments uniquely determine $\rho$. If the Rankin-Selberg integral
  were sign-preserving, this would pin down the zeros — but it is not.

  4. The residue discrimination at varying central charge $c$. The residue of the functional-equation factor at a zeta-zero pole $s = (1+\rho)/2$ is a specific function $R(c,\rho)$ of $c$ involving gamma
  factors. For on-line zeros ($\mathrm{Re}(\rho) = 1/2$) vs off-line zeros ($\mathrm{Re}(\rho) \neq 1/2$), these are provably different functions of $c$. The bootstrap idea: if the MC-constrained values
  of $\varepsilon^c_s$ across all $c$ are incompatible with $R(c,\sigma)$ for $\sigma \neq 1/2$, those pole locations are excluded.

  ---
  The structural obstruction

  Your investigation already identified this clearly (rem:structural-obstruction), and it's the honest core of the matter:

  The shadow tower constrains spectral coefficients $c(t)$ on the real spectral line ($s = 1/2 + it$, $t \in \mathbb{R}$). The zeta zeros live at complex spectral parameters ($s = \rho/2$, $\mathrm{Re}(s)
   \neq 1/2$ generically). The algebraic MC constraints cannot reach the scattering poles without analytic continuation of spectral data off the real axis.

  This is not a gap that can be closed by more computation within the existing framework. It is the dividing line between what the modular bootstrap does (constrain real spectral data) and what RH is
  about (location of complex resonances). Bridging it is the domain of the Langlands programme, not the MC equation.

  ---
  What is genuinely new and worth stating

  The sharpest clean mathematical statement is the shadow-spectral correspondence: shadow depth $d(A)$ counts the number of independent L-functions in the Epstein zeta of a lattice VOA, via the Hecke
  decomposition of the theta function. This is a genuine Chriss-Ginzburg identification — the combinatorial data of the shadow tower (graph sums through arity $r$) activates successive Hecke eigenspaces
  of the modular-form ring, and each eigenspace contributes exactly one L-function factor.

  The deeper question — whether the full shadow tower of a depth-$\infty$ algebra like Virasoro, through its infinite moment constraints on $\varepsilon^c_s$ varying over all $c$, can exclude off-line
  scattering poles — remains genuinely open and is the most interesting direction in this programme.

❯ our chiral koszul duality implements the geometric langlands correspondence, so what is truly missing /obstructed in relaxing The structural obstruction

  Your investigation already identified this clearly (rem:structural-obstruction), and it's the honest core of the matter:

  The shadow tower constrains spectral coefficients $c(t)$ on the real spectral line ($s = 1/2 + it$, $t \in \mathbb{R}$). The zeta zeros live at complex spectral parameters ($s = \rho/2$,

⏺ This is a sharp observation. Let me think about this carefully — if chiral Koszul duality really implements geometric Langlands, then the "structural obstruction" I stated may not be as fundamental as I
   claimed. Let me re-examine what the actual obstruction is.

⏺ You're right to push back on this. Let me re-examine the obstruction more carefully, because the claim that "this is the domain of the Langlands programme, not the MC equation" was lazy — if the
  bar-cobar framework is a chain-level model for geometric Langlands, then the MC equation and the Langlands programme are not separate domains.

  Let me identify the genuine obstructions with more precision.

  The structural obstruction, revisited

  What I said was: "the shadow tower constrains $c(t)$ on the real spectral line; zeta zeros live at complex spectral parameters; bridging requires analytic continuation." This is true as a description
  but misleading as a diagnosis, because it treats the spectral decomposition on $\mathcal{M}_{1,1}$ as an external fact rather than something the framework should explain.

  Here's the sharper decomposition of what's actually missing. There are three genuine gaps, and they are not of equal depth.

  ---
  Gap 1: The intertwining operator — bar-cobar inversion

  At critical level, the bar complex computes opers (thm:langlands-bar-bridge, PROVED). The bar-cobar adjunction with Verdier intertwining implements the localization functor. The bar-cobar inversion
  (Theorem B) — $\Omega(B(A)) \xrightarrow{\sim} A$ on the Koszul locus — is the algebraic analogue of the intertwining operator in the Langlands programme.

  The scattering matrix $\varphi(s) = \Lambda(1-s)/\Lambda(s)$ on $\mathcal{M}_{1,1}$ is an intertwining operator — it intertwines the principal series at $s$ and $1-s$. Its poles at $s = \rho/2$ are
  where the intertwining fails to be an isomorphism.

  The bar-cobar inversion also has a locus where it fails — the non-Koszul locus.

  The missing identification: Is there a deformation parameter for chiral algebras (analogous to the spectral parameter $s$) such that bar-cobar inversion degenerates at the same values where the
  scattering matrix has poles?

  For the critical-level affine algebra $\hat{\mathfrak{g}}_{-h^\vee}$: the curvature $\kappa$ vanishes, the bar complex is uncurved, and the cohomology is the oper space. The opers parametrize flat ${}^L
   G$-connections. The spectral parameter $s$ in the Eisenstein series corresponds to a point in the space of Langlands parameters. The poles of $\varphi(s)$ correspond to non-generic Langlands parameters
   where the principal series becomes reducible.

  In bar-cobar language: the MC element $\Theta_A$ at critical level should detect these reducibility points. The shadow tower projects out the finite-order data; the poles of $\varphi$ should appear as
  singularities of the shadow generating function continued to complex parameters.

  For Virasoro: $G(t) = -\log(1 + 6t/c)$ has a pole at $t = -c/6$. This is a single singularity in the shadow GF. But $\varphi(s)$ has infinitely many poles (one per zeta zero). So the shadow GF's
  singularity structure does NOT directly reproduce the zeta zeros — it captures only the effective coupling $\lambda_{\text{eff}} = -6/c$, not the individual resonances.

  Status: This is a genuine obstruction. The shadow tower's singularities are controlled by the algebra's OPE structure (finite data), while the scattering poles are controlled by the arithmetic of primes
   (infinite data). The Langlands parametrization maps between these two kinds of data, but the bar-cobar framework currently captures only the automorphic side (the partition function as a function on
  $\mathcal{M}_{1,1}$), not the spectral side (the Langlands parameters as complex geometric data).

  What would close it: A Langlands-parametrized family of chiral algebras $A_s$ (parametrized by $s \in \mathrm{Op}_{{}^LG}$) such that the bar-cobar inversion obstruction class $o(A_s)$ has poles exactly
   at the scattering poles of $\varphi(s)$. The oper space IS computed by the bar complex — but the parametrization of families of algebras by opers requires the full geometric Langlands EQUIVALENCE, not
  just the localization.

  ---
  Gap 2: The arithmetic descent — function field to number field

  Geometric Langlands operates over the function field $k(X)$ of a curve $X$. The bar complex of a chiral algebra on $X$ computes sheaves on $\mathrm{Loc}_{{}^LG}(X)$. This is the geometric side.

  The zeta zeros belong to the arithmetic side — $\zeta(s)$ is the L-function of $\mathrm{Spec}(\mathbb{Z})$, not of a curve. The spectral decomposition on $\mathcal{M}_{1,1} =
  \mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{Z})\backslash\mathbb{H}$ is automorphic over $\mathbb{Q}$, not over a function field.

  The Rankin-Selberg integral bridges these: it takes the partition function $Z_A(\tau)$ (a function on the moduli of curves, hence "geometric") and produces an L-function (an "arithmetic" object). For
  lattice VOAs, this works because $\Theta_\Lambda(\tau)$ is a classical modular form, and the Hecke decomposition $\Theta_\Lambda = \sum a_j f_j$ directly yields L-functions $L(s, f_j)$ with full
  analytic continuation.

  The obstruction for non-lattice theories: The partition function of the Virasoro algebra is NOT a classical modular form — it's essentially $\chi_c(\tau) = q^{(c-1)/24}/\eta(\tau)$, which is a
  weight-$(-1/2)$ modular form (up to anomaly). The Hecke theory for such objects is:
  - Weight $< 0$: not a holomorphic modular form, Hecke operators don't act classically
  - VVMF (vector-valued): for rational VOAs, the character vector IS a VVMF, and Franc-Mason (2017) develop Hecke operators — but the theory is conjectural for the Langlands parametrization

  What would close it: A VVMF Hecke theory that provides:
  1. Decomposition of the character vector into Hecke eigenforms
  2. Each eigenform $\to$ an L-function with analytic continuation
  3. The Langlands parametrization of these L-functions by opers

  This is Approach B of the spectral continuation programme. It's conjectural, but the ingredients exist (Franc-Mason, Bantay-Gannon, Mason-Marks).

  Key point: This gap is NOT about "the framework can't do analytic continuation." It's about extending the Hecke theory from classical modular forms (lattice case, PROVED) to vector-valued modular forms
  (general case, CONJECTURAL). The bar-cobar framework provides the input (the partition function as a section of a vector bundle on $\mathcal{M}_{g,n}$); the Hecke theory provides the bridge to
  L-functions.

  ---
  Gap 3: The non-perturbative completion — from shadow tower to sewing envelope

  The shadow tower $\Theta_A^{\leq r}$ is perturbative — arity by arity. Each truncation gives finitely many constraints on the spectral coefficients. But the scattering matrix has infinitely many poles,
  so no finite truncation can detect them all.

  The full MC element $\Theta_A = \varprojlim \Theta_A^{\leq r}$ exists (thm:recursive-existence, PROVED) and contains all the information. But extracting the scattering data from $\Theta_A$ requires the
  analytic completion $A^{\text{sew}}$, not just the formal inverse limit.

  The chain is:
  $$\Theta_A^{\leq r} ;\xrightarrow{\text{inverse limit}}; \Theta_A ;\xrightarrow{\text{sewing envelope}}; \Theta_A^{\text{an}} ;\xrightarrow{\text{Rankin-Selberg}}; \varepsilon^c_s
  ;\xrightarrow{\text{Hecke}}; {L(s, f_j)}$$

  The first arrow is PROVED. The second requires HS-sewing (PROVED for the standard landscape, thm:general-hs-sewing). The third is the Rankin-Selberg integral (PROVED for lattice, the sewing-Selberg
  formula). The fourth is the Hecke decomposition (PROVED for lattice, CONJECTURAL for non-lattice).

  What would close it: The coderived analytic shadow $Q_g^{\text{an}}(A)$ at genus $g \geq 2$ needs to be developed. At genus 1, curvature $d^2 = \kappa\omega_1$ forces the coderived category. The full
  coderived Ran-space formalism would provide the analytic continuation mechanism through the singularities of the sewing operator — the poles of the sewing Fredholm determinant are EXACTLY the scattering
   poles of $\varphi(s)$ when integrated over $\mathcal{M}_{1,1}$.

  ---
  The honest summary

  The structural obstruction is real but it's not as monolithic as I stated. It decomposes into three pieces of unequal difficulty:

  └───────────────────────────────────────┴────────────────────────────┴──────────────────┴───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

  The deepest gap is Gap 1: identifying the bar-cobar inversion obstruction with the scattering poles. This is where the Langlands equivalence (not just localization) would need to be used. The bar
  complex at critical level computes the oper space, but relating the parametrized family of inversion obstructions to the poles of the intertwining operator requires understanding how the bar-cobar
  adjunction varies as the Langlands parameter moves through the oper space.

  Gaps 2 and 3 are more tractable and represent genuine next steps. In particular, the VVMF Hecke theory for rational VOAs is a well-defined mathematical problem with known ingredients, and the coderived
  formalism extends an already-proved HS-sewing result.

❯ fundamentally attack ALL future forward vectors simultaneously, using a swarm of multiplicity-greater-than-one-per-color red team blue green team orange team magenta team methods. multiplicity more than one means that there are multiple agents launched per color

I’m turning this into a coordinated multi-front research architecture: multiple agents per color will attack each gap from construction and adversarial sides, with explicit cross-checks against what is already proved versus conjectural.

The attack is now anchored on the exact forward vectors already in the notes, with the central target reframed as the missing single object carrying operic parameter, Hecke transport, and analytic sewing together. I’m also folding in a concrete Orange/Magenta bridge via boundary chiral algebras, universal-defect quadratic duality, and line-operator dg-shifted Yangians.

Yes. The right move is not one more linear pass; it is a coordinated swarm in which each color attacks a different bottleneck and each color contains multiple independent agents.

Beilinson–Drinfeld’s complementarity principle already gives the ambient grammar: functions multiply in the

Red team: obstruction hunters and falsifiers

Red-1: fake-spectral adversary
Try to manufacture off-critical-line resonance patterns from finite shadow data alone. The goal is to prove a negative statement: finite-order shadow constraints can mimic many real-line spectral moments but cannot rigidly determine pole locations. If Red-1 succeeds too often, then any proposed RH attack based only on low-order shadows is dead.

Blue is the only team trying to build the missing bridge, not just describe it.

Green team: arithmetic descent and Hecke extraction

Green-1: VVMF/character Heckeizer
Take rational or controlled non-rational families and develop Hecke operators on the character vector, not just on scalar modular forms. The task is to turn chiral character data into honest spectral packets: Eisenstein pieces, cusp pieces, and their associated Dirichlet/Mellin transforms. This is the real attack on the “arithmetic descent” gap.

Green-2: defect-to-
𝐿
L-function transducer
Because the quadratic dual is interpreted as the universal defect chiral algebra, and because the physical definition of the dual is meant to encode all consistent couplings, Green-2 tries to compute arithmetic spectral data from defect partition functions / defect characters rather than from the bulk partition function directly. This is important: defects may linearize otherwise inaccessible bulk modular data.

Green turns chiral data into arithmetic data.

Orange team: analytic continuation and scattering

Orange-2: real-line to complex-plane extension
You already identified the structural obstruction correctly: the shadow tower controls real spectral data, while zeta zeros are complex resonances. Orange-2’s job is to build the analytic continuation functorially from the chiral side, using completed MC data rather than ad hoc Mellin transforms.

Orange-3: positivity and moment-problem enforcer
Try to prove sign/positivity statements for the resulting spectral measure. If such a statement survives the modular/quartic corrections, it can force the continuation to stay on a constrained locus and may exclude off-line poles. If no positivity survives, that tells you exactly what extra modular information is missing.

Orange is the analytic front end of the program.

Magenta team: boundary, holography, and computational realization

Magenta-1: boundary algebra realization
Use boundary chiral algebras and twisted/celestial holography as the concrete laboratory where universal defects become explicit. This is the most computationally accessible place to test the dual/defect dictionary, because boundary algebras are often easier to compute than bulk Koszul duals.

Magenta-2: boundary-to-genus sewing

,
arithmetic descent gap becomes the extraction of Hecke/scattering data from the same family,
non-perturbative completion gap becomes the existence of the completed cyclic MC object.
What I would prioritize

If the swarm has to choose a spine, it is:

Blue-1 + Blue-2 + Green-1 + Magenta-1.

That spine tries to prove:

there is a completed, parametrized twisting family;
it has a boundary/defect realization;
its characters admit a Hecke/arithmetic transform;
its degenerations are detected by nonlinear modular shadows.

Everything else either stress-tests or refines this spine.

What this changes conceptually

The old obstruction statement was:

“the shadow tower only sees the real spectral line, so it cannot reach scattering poles.”

The stronger replacement is:

“a finite shadow tower only sees the real spectral line; but a completed, genus-parametrized, defect-realized Maurer–Cartan family can in principle analytically continue to the scattering side.”

That is the relaxation you were pushing for.

The sharpest single attack sentence

If I had to compress the whole swarm to one research move, it is this:

	​

, then compare the degeneration locus of its universal twisting morphism with the automorphic scattering poles extracted from the boundary/defect character package.

That hits every forward vector at once.

The place where I’m least certain is the exact analytic mechanism that turns the completed chiral MC family into the relevant scattering matrix; that still looks like the most delicate piece. But it is now a precise target, not a vague obstruction.

push foundationally on the mathematics here. Employ sasha beilinson's deep principle: what holds back forward progress is not often a lack of genius, but rather the inability to dismiss false ideas.

I’m going to recast this as a falsification problem: isolate the strongest seductive claims, kill the ones that are mathematically incoherent, and keep only the structures that survive contact with precise definitions and functoriality.

don't JUST do a falsification pass. Achieve both falsificatio and push forward on the true frontier (that survives). Construct elegant, groundbreaking new mathematics

Then I’ll rebuild only the surviving frontier around the few hard claims that genuinely map chiral data to automorphic resonances, pressure-testing your conjectural spine against the source mathematics.

The constructive pivot is now clear: the arithmetic burden belongs on a formal-moduli-valued chiral object, not another finite invariant. Its tangent cone should recover the shadow tower, while its failure of acyclicity becomes the first plausible resonance divisor.

Thought for 17m 28s

Yes. The Beilinson move here is:

kill the false universalities, then make the surviving structure so rigid that it starts proving things.

So let me do both.

I. What should be discarded

The first false idea is that “chiral Koszul duality” is already a completed theorem in the sense needed for this program. It is not. What is actually proved is a quadratic-duality/Maurer–Cartan dictionary for dualizable quadratic chiral data, with injectivity in general and bijectivity only under extra effectiveness hypotheses; the full notion of Koszulness and the necessary homotopy setting are explicitly left open.

The second false idea is that the CDG shadow is the right carrier of all dual information. Gui–Li–Zeng say the opposite: passing from the twisted pair
(
𝐵
,
𝐵
∘
,
𝑆
)
(B,B
∘
,S) to the CDG chiral algebra
(
𝐵
,
𝑑
,
𝜄
)
(B,d,ι) loses information, and the twisted pair is the better object for curved chiral chains. That is not a side remark; it tells us exactly where earlier formulations were collapsing too much structure.

The third false idea is that finite-order shadow data should already control the spectral/arithmetic frontier. Even your own recursive-loop note says finite cascades can track arithmetic information but cannot reproduce the emergent spectral structure of the zeros; the zeros only appear after infinite completion and analytic continuation. So any approach that expects a finite shadow tower, by itself, to localize zeta zeros is aiming at the wrong target.

The fourth false idea is that modularity alone already gives automorphic
𝐿
L-data. Boundary characters can be modular or modular-like, but that is weaker than having a Hecke package, an Euler product, or a scattering theory. Costello–Dimofte–Gaiotto explicitly frame modularity here as suggestive, not as an arithmetic completion.

Those four things should be removed from the core.

II. What survives

Three structures survive every pruning pass.

First, the twisted pair

(
𝐵
⊂
𝐵
∘
,
  
𝑆
)
(B⊂B
∘
,S)

survives. It is the dual object before information is lost, and it carries the natural twisted Maurer–Cartan equation

𝜇
(
(
𝑆
+
𝛼
)
⊠
(
𝑆
+
𝛼
)
)
=
0.
μ((S+α)⊠(S+α))=0.

Moreover, for dualizable effective QLS data there is a bijection between morphisms out of the original chiral algebra and solutions of this twisted MC equation. That is already a real moduli statement, not just an analogy.

Second, the derived bulk-boundary map

𝛽

e
r
:
𝑉

(
𝑉
∂
)
d
e
r
β
der
	​

)
der
	​


survives. In the 3d holomorphic-topological setting, Costello–Dimofte–Gaiotto explicitly point to the derived center / Hochschild-cohomology reconstruction principle as the right enhancement, and note that sufficiently rich boundary data should reconstruct the bulk.

Third, the line-operator Koszul dual

𝐴
!
A
!

survives. In the 2025 line-operator paper, perturbative line operators are organized as
𝐴
!
A
!
-modules, and
𝐴
!
A
!
 is endowed with a universal Maurer–Cartan element
𝑟
(
𝑧
)
r(z) satisfying an
𝐴
∞
A
∞
	​

-Yang–Baxter-type relation; in the classes treated there, the authors claim the full dg-shifted Yangian structure can be proved algebraically. Even if one treats the broader claims cautiously, this is exactly the kind of rigid algebraic frontier that survives falsification.

And there is one geometric laboratory that is much more solid than the others:

the lattice/Heisenberg/Picard sector of Beilinson–Drinfeld. Lattice chiral algebras are controlled by local Picard geometry,
𝜃
θ-data, and Heisenberg groups; their local module theory is Heisenberg representation theory, and their global chiral homology is tied to theta functions via Fourier–Mukai. That is the correct place to make the first theorem-grade advance.

III. The new mathematics: the object that should replace the old program

Here is the replacement.

Definition: spectral twisted pair

For a chiral algebra
𝐴
A, a spectral twisted pair presentation consists of:

a twisted pair
𝑇
𝐴

compatible with line OPE.

The point is that the old program tried to read arithmetic directly from
𝐴
A. The new program says: the correct carrier of arithmetic/spectral structure is not
𝐴
A alone, but the quadruple

𝑆

𝐴

:

This is already grounded:

	​

 and
𝑟

r

	​

(z) are justified by the line-operator/dg-shifted-Yangian picture.

This is the first genuinely better object.

IV. The first theorem to target
Theorem A (Twisted-pair deformation theorem)

For dualizable effective chiral QLS data, the functor of deformations of chiral morphisms out of
𝐴
A is represented by the twisted Maurer–Cartan functor of its spectral twisted pair:

∣μ((S+α)⊠(S+α))=0}/∼.

What is new here is not the set-level bijection; that is already visible in the special-case theorem of Gui–Li–Zeng. The new claim is the deformation-functor enhancement. The Kontsevich–Soibelman
𝐿
∞
L
∞
	​

-philosophy says quasi-isomorphic deformation theories have equivalent MC functors; this is the correct homotopy packaging of the chiral story.

This theorem is believable because the set-level correspondences are already there. The missing step is to put them in a curved
𝐿
∞
L
∞
	​

-envelope rather than a raw set of solutions.

V. The second theorem to target
Theorem B (Boundary–line reconstruction principle)

Assume
𝐴
A admits a sufficiently rich boundary condition
𝑏
b and a perturbative line category
𝐶
𝐴
C
A
	​

. Then there is a zig-zag of quasi-isomorphisms

𝐴

(
1
)
.
A≃HH
∙
(V
∂
	​

[b])≃End
C
A
	​

	​

(1).

This is the theorem that fuses the two surviving frontiers:

derived center from boundary chiral algebra, from Costello–Dimofte–Gaiotto;
reconstruction from the unit object in the chiral category of lines.

As stated, this is conjectural in general. But it is the correct theorem to aim at, because it identifies the same bulk algebra from two different surviving completions. That is exactly the kind of double-anchoring that dismisses false ideas.

VI. The third theorem to target — and the one most relevant to the zeta/automorphic frontier
Theorem C (Heisenberg–Fourier–Koszul theorem) — lattice case

For a lattice chiral algebra
𝐴
𝜃
A
θ
	​

 with
𝜃
θ-datum
𝜃
=
(
𝜅
,
𝜆
,
𝑐
)
θ=(κ,λ,c), the spectral twisted pair
𝑆
(
𝐴
𝜃
)
S(A
θ
	​

) determines
𝜃
θ functorially, and the genus-one categorical trace of its line category is naturally identified with the Fourier–Mukai transform of the corresponding Picard-line-bundle data.

Why this is the right theorem:

BD tell us lattice chiral algebras are equivalent to
𝜃
θ-data, built from divisor/Picard geometry.
Their local theory is Heisenberg group representation theory.
Their global chiral homology is computed by a Fourier–Mukai/theta-function mechanism.

So in the lattice sector, the three worlds you care about are already present:
local Heisenberg,
global theta/Fourier,
and dual/MC algebra.

That means the lattice case is where one can first prove that Koszul-dual / boundary / categorical data really does recover a modular object. Not zeta zeros yet, but an honest theorem that the spectral envelope of a chiral algebra produces automorphic geometry.

This is the place to be ambitious and rigorous at once.

VII. The genuinely new conjecture

Here is the strongest version I think survives falsification.

Conjecture (automorphic trace conjecture)

For any chiral algebra
𝐴
A in a class admitting spectral twisted pair data, define its spectral trace sheaf

𝑇
𝐴
:
=
Tr
⁡
c
a
t
(
𝐶
𝐴
)
T
A
	​

:=Tr
cat

and its genus-one character

𝜒
𝐴

A
	​

(τ):=Tr
T
A
	​

	​

(q
L
0
	​

−
24
c
	​

).

Then:

in the lattice case,
𝜒
𝐴
χ
A
	​

 is the theta/Fourier–Mukai object of BD;
in perturbative HT theories,
𝜒
𝐴
χ
A
	​

 is governed by the dg-shifted-Yangian kernel
𝑟
𝐴
(
𝑧
)
r
A
	​

(z);

the poles/functional equations of the meromorphic continuation of
𝜒
𝐴
χ
A
	​

 are controlled not by the bare MC element in
𝐴
A, but by the pair

(
𝛽
d
e
r
,
 
𝑟
𝐴
(
𝑧
)
)
.
(β
der
	​

,r
A
	​

(z)).

That last clause is the key correction to the old idea. The arithmetic frontier is not extracted from a single Maurer–Cartan class in the bulk algebra. It is extracted from the interaction between boundary reconstruction and line-OPE reconstruction.

That is new, and I think it is the right formulation.

VIII. Why this is better than the old “shadow tower → zeros” idea

Because it resolves the exact obstruction.

The old setup tried to go:

finite chiral data
→
real spectral moments
→
complex pole locations
.
finite chiral data→real spectral moments→complex pole locations.

That is too thin.

The new setup goes:

𝐴

C

	​

⇝meromorphic/modular object.

This route has three advantages:

it keeps the information that the CDG truncation loses;
it uses a reconstruction theorem that is already expected from boundary theory;
it imports a genuinely spectral object
𝑟
(
𝑧
)
r(z), not just a formal deformation parameter.

So the program stops being “maybe the moments know the zeros” and becomes “build the spectral envelope in which poles and functional equations actually live.”

IX. The first concrete proof strategy

I would attack it in this order.

Step 1. Prove Theorem A in the quadratic/effective setting by constructing the curved
𝐿
∞
L
∞
	​

 enhancement of the twisted-pair Maurer–Cartan functor.

Step 2. Prove Theorem C for lattice chiral algebras, where BD already give the Picard/Heisenberg/Fourier–Mukai geometry.

Step 3. In perturbative HT theories, replace the heuristic
𝐴
!
A
!
-module picture by the dg-shifted-Yangian package and show that the categorical trace is controlled by
𝑟
(
𝑧
)
r(z).

Step 4. Only then ask whether the resulting meromorphic continuation has an arithmetic incarnation strong enough to speak to zeta-type zero structures.

That is the right Beilinson discipline: do not ask the grand question before you have built the object in which the question even makes sense.

X. The shortest honest summary

What dies:

naive CDG reduction,
finite-shadow spectral optimism,
“modularity implies arithmetic”,
“chiral Koszul duality is already complete.”

What survives:

twisted pairs,
derived bulk-boundary reconstruction,
line categories and their Koszul dual
𝐴
!
A
!
,
the spectral kernel
𝑟
(
𝑧
)
r(z),
the lattice/Heisenberg/Fourier–Mukai laboratory.

What should be built:

the spectral twisted pair
𝑆
(
𝐴
)
S(A),
the Boundary–Line Reconstruction Principle,
the Heisenberg–Fourier–Koszul theorem in the lattice case,
and then the automorphic trace conjecture.

That is not just a falsification pass. It is a replacement of the loose program by a smaller, harder, much more beautiful one.

Vol2Archive.zip
Zip Archive
Vol1Archive.zip
Zip Archive
here is our frontier research program. Do your claims hold up to scrutiy?

I’m going to audit my earlier claims against your actual program materials rather than generic literature, extracting the archive contents and sorting each point into supported, overstated, or not yet earned.

The archive is richer than I expected: beyond theorem ledgers and proof atlases, it already asserts stronger structures than I credited, including a 12-way chiral Koszulness theorem and bar–cobar inversion on the Koszul locus. So I’m now checking whether those flagship claims are logged as proved, conditional, or frontier inside your own audit tables before I retract or upgrade anything.

I’ve finished the audit: the program’s algebraic core and computational spine look internally healthy, but the manuscripts themselves are more nuanced than some top-level summaries suggest. The main revisions are status corrections and a sharper rewrite where your archive both strengthens the bulk–boundary–line and universal-MC story, yet disallows one compressed identification I made.

Thought for 16m 36s

At the level of theorem/conjecture boundaries and internal consistency in Vol. I and Vol. II, not every claim I made survives unchanged.

The short verdict is: the core survives, but I overstated in two places, understated in one place, and invented one organizing object that your program already supersedes.

I pulled the decisive excerpts into an audit note here: claim scrutiny audit and a shorter verdict matrix.

The part that does hold up strongly is the twisted-pair / higher-structure diagnosis. The external GLZ paper really does only give a general injective map

with bijectivity only under effectiveness hypotheses, and it explicitly says that a full homotopy/Koszul treatment is still future work; it also introduces twisted pairs
(
𝐵
,
𝐵
∘
,
𝑆
)
(B,B
∘
,S) and the curved Maurer–Cartan equation. Against that background, your Vol. II modular PVA quantization chapter is perfectly aligned when it says the associated CDG algebra forgets information and that the real frontier is a curved modular bar–cobar adjunction for twisted pairs, not just for bare CDG data. So my insistence that “twisted-pair data is structurally more fundamental than its CDG shadow” survives scrutiny.

The other part that survives is the structural obstruction in the arithmetic direction. Your arithmetic_shadows.tex says this almost exactly: the shadow tower / MC constraints live on the real spectral line, while the scattering poles carrying the zeta-zero information sit at complex spectral parameters, so no direct zero-forcing mechanism operates without analytic continuation. That means my earlier statement that finite or purely real-line shadow constraints cannot by themselves force zeta-zero locations is not just compatible with your program; it is already part of it.

Where I was too negative was in saying, in effect, that “chiral Koszul duality is not yet a completed theorem in the sense needed here.” That is fair as a statement about the GLZ quadratic locus, but it is not a fair summary of your program. Your Vol. I README claims a much larger proved core: geometric bar–cobar duality, bar–cobar inversion, cyclic

	​

, and even a 12-way “Koszulness meta-theorem.” So the corrected statement is: GLZ is one input that remains limited; your program claims to supersede that limitation on a much larger homotopy/modular stage. My previous formulation blurred those two levels.

Where I was too positive was in packaging a broad “Boundary–Line Reconstruction Principle” as though it were globally established. Your Vol. II README advertises Theorem J in a strong global form, but the body of ht_bulk_boundary_line_core.tex is more precise: the corrected triangle

That is also consistent with Costello–Dimofte–Gaiotto, who only expect the derived bulk-boundary map to be an isomorphism for sufficiently rich boundaries and defer the full statement to future work. So that claim survives only in a qualified form.

My discussion of line operators and dg-shifted Yangians mostly survives, but again with a qualifier I should have made explicit. Your line-operator and spectral-braiding chapters state these as proved under standing hypotheses
(

-algebra, with rich boundary conditions relating them to boundary-VOA modules. So this is a real pillar, but not an unconditional one.

The biggest thing I would now withdraw is my ad hoc “spectral twisted pair” as the new master organizing object. Your program already has a stronger and cleaner object:

𝐻

𝐴

),

the holographic modular Koszul datum, and your own text says it is not a new layer glued on top, but a repackaging of
Θ
𝐴
Θ
A
	​

 and its projections. So my object is, at best, a partial shadow of something your program already defines more naturally. That part of my answer does not hold up.

The weakest part of my previous answer is the automorphic trace conjecture. I do not think that currently survives scrutiny. In the files I audited, your actual arithmetic interface is not a categorical trace of the line category. It is the constrained Epstein zeta
𝜀
𝑠
𝑐
ε
s
c
	​

, the sewing–Rankin–Selberg bridge, Eisenstein coefficients, and the scattering matrix. CDG do discuss characters and holomorphic blocks, and the line-operator paper discusses a boundary functor to VOA modules, but that is not enough to justify the specific automorphic machine I proposed. So that conjecture should be dropped or relabeled as purely speculative.

The best corrected frontier, after this audit, is:

Keep the twisted-pair correction.
The real curved modular extension should be built for
(
𝐵
,
𝐵
∘
,
𝑆
)
(B,B
∘
,S), not for stripped-down CDG data.
Keep the arithmetic obstruction exactly as stated.
Any zeta-zero attack has to pass through analytic continuation of the spectral data, not just shadow moments on the real line.
Replace my organizing object by your own.
Work inside the holographic modular Koszul datum
𝐻
(
𝐴
)
H(A), not my “spectral twisted pair.”
Narrow the bulk-boundary-line theorem.
Treat the global triangle as formal-under-hypotheses plus exact local sectors, unless and until the all-theory conjectural step is closed.
Drop the categorical-trace-to-automorphic conjecture for now.
Your existing arithmetic chapter already gives the right interface; that is where the pressure should go.

So the honest answer is: some of my claims do hold up, but not in the form I gave them. The deepest surviving part is the Beilinson move itself: the false universalities to discard are

“your theory is still only at the GLZ stage,” and
“the global bulk-boundary-line reconstruction is already theorem-grade without hypotheses.”

What survives after that pruning is sharper and better: twisted pairs, the holographic modular Koszul datum, the qualified bulk-boundary-line triangle, and the arithmetic shadow/scattering interface.

what do we need to do to fully understand analytic continuation regarding the arithmetic/scattering frontier

I’m checking your arithmetic-shadow and scattering framework itself first, so I can separate what is already formalized from the genuinely missing analytic-continuation steps and turn that into a concrete closure agenda.

I’ve now narrowed it to a real checklist: define the completed chiral/spectral object in the correct analytic-homotopy category, continue both the arithmetic and QFT sides, and prove sewing identifies their continuations with the scattering/intertwining operator.

The bottleneck is clearer now: you need four comparison theorems in sequence—completed chiral object, analytic factorization object, automorphic/Mellin object, and then the canonical scattering operator. I’m now checking which ingredients are already supported by graph/Feynman calculus, boundary/defect realization, and the scattering dictionary, versus which still remain external.

Thought for 22m 18s

After checking the extracted frontier chapter and the supporting papers, I think the right formulation is this:

To fully understand analytic continuation at the arithmetic/scattering frontier, you have to solve a comparison problem between two different spectral objects, not merely continue one Dirichlet series.

I pulled the exact frontier excerpts here: frontier excerpt. I also condensed the roadmap here: analytic continuation roadmap.

The false ideas to dismiss first are:

More finite shadow data will eventually force the zeros.
It will not. Your own frontier chapter says the shadow/MC constraints live on the real spectral line, while the scattering poles carrying zeta-zero information sit at complex spectral parameters. That is a structural separation, not a computational inconvenience.
The uncompleted functional-equation factor is the real scattering object.
It is not. The completed scattering matrix is the object that matters; otherwise you chase fake poles that disappear after completion.
The problem is only arithmetic.
It is not. It is simultaneously arithmetic, automorphic, and QFT-analytic.

What actually has to be built is this.

First, you need a completed arithmetic transform. Right now the natural arithmetic avatar is the constrained Epstein zeta / Eisenstein coefficient package. But “fully understanding analytic continuation” means producing a functorial object

𝐴
𝐶
(
𝐴
)
AC(A)

from your completed chiral/sewing data to a meromorphic spectral object on the automorphic side, and proving that it is normalized from the outset by the completed scattering matrix. In the lattice case, your extracted chapter already sketches the prototype: Hecke decomposition plus Mellin transform. Outside the lattice case, that object is still missing.

Second, you need the non-lattice continuation theorem. The archive chapter itself says the lattice story works cleanly because Hecke decomposition gives honest
𝐿
L-functions, while Virasoro/rational cases require the spectral theory of character vectors as vector-valued modular forms. That is the next decisive theorem: build a Rankin–Selberg/Hecke package for VVMFs strong enough to produce meromorphic continuation and explicit spectral packets. Until that exists, the arithmetic/scattering frontier is only fully understood for the lattice sector.

Third, you need to separate arithmetic content from homotopy defect. The extracted chapter’s depth decomposition

𝑑
(
𝐴
)
=
1
+
𝑑
a
r
i
t
h
(

)
+
𝑑
a
l
g
(
𝐴
)
d(A)=1+d
arith
	​

(A)+d
alg
	​

(A)

is exactly the right guide. The arithmetic part is what should survive Hecke–Mellin continuation. The algebraic part is the homotopy/non-formality residue that inflates shadow depth without creating new critical lines. So a full understanding of analytic continuation requires a theorem of the form:

𝑑
a
r
i
t
h
d
arith
	​

 is the image of the completed continuation functor,
𝑑
a
l
g
d
alg
	​

 is the kernel/cokernel defect coming from
𝐴
∞
A
∞
	​

-non-formality and cusp singularity.

That is a much sharper target than “continue the series.”

Fourth, you need to put the QFT side of continuation on a rigorous invariant footing. The perturbative side is not hopeless here. In Higher Operations in Perturbation Theory, deformations are organized as a formal pointed dg-supermanifold with nilpotent vector field
𝜂
η, and consistent deformations are exactly Maurer–Cartan zeros of the corresponding
𝐿
∞
L
∞
	​

 structure; different renormalization schemes are related by formal maps reducing to
𝐿
∞
L
∞
	​

 quasi-isomorphisms. More importantly, the same paper shows that a mild analytic continuation can turn the formal perturbative integrals into manifestly finite integrals, and the resulting regions satisfy quadratic identities implying associativity.

That tells you something important: on the QFT side, analytic continuation should be defined up to
𝐿
∞
L
∞
	​

 quasi-isomorphism, not coefficientwise. So the correct continuation theorem is not about raw Feynman coefficients; it is about the quasi-isomorphism class of the completed deformation theory.

Fifth, you need a geometric realization of the continuation. The boundary/Grassmannian side is the best current candidate. Boundary Chiral Algebras and Holomorphic Twists shows that boundary bundles trivialized on the boundary can be assumed to analytically extend to the punctured disc with finite-order poles, and this identifies the complex-analytic affine Grassmannian with the algebro-geometric one; local operators are then described by Dolbeault cohomology on the affine Grassmannian, and correlation functions are induced by maps from products of affine Grassmannians to
B
u
n
𝐺
Bun
G
	​

. The same paper also shows how varying punctured-disc data produces spectral-flow-like boundary modules over
G
r
𝐺
Gr
G
	​

.

That is exactly the sort of geometry where continuation should live: not as an ad hoc contour trick, but as motion in a punctured-disc / affine-Grassmannian family.

Sixth, and this is the real heart, you need the comparison theorem between the two spectral measures. Your extracted chapter explicitly distinguishes:

the shadow spectral measure
𝜌
ρ, determined by the MC/shadow data, and
the automorphic scattering object
𝜑
(
𝑠
)
φ(s), coming from the Laplacian on
S
L
2
(
𝑍
)
\
𝐻
SL
2
	​

(Z)\H.

It then says the Rankin–Selberg map from the first to the second is injective in the lattice case, ill-conditioned in non-lattice cases, and not surjective in general. That is the frontier. Not “derive RH from shadows,” but:

Describe the image of the completed Rankin–Selberg map
𝑅
𝑆
:
𝜌
𝐴
⟶
𝜑
𝐴
.
Describe the image of the completed Rankin–Selberg mapRS:ρ
A
	​

⟶φ
A
	​

.

Until you know the image, cokernel, and residue behavior of that map, you do not yet understand analytic continuation at the arithmetic/scattering frontier.

The structural packaging from the Koszul-dual side supports this. The 2023 holography/Koszul paper frames universal defects and boundary algebras as two realizations of Koszul duality, with

𝑀
𝐶
(
𝐴
⊗
𝐵
)
=
H
o
m
(
𝐴
!
,
𝐵
)
MC(A⊗B)=Hom(A
!
,B)

and boundary-dual descriptions tied together by KK reduction. So the continuation problem should probably be posed not on the bare bulk algebra alone, but on a bulk–defect–boundary package whose deformation theory already knows how to move between these realizations.

The minimum theorem stack I would try to prove is:

A generalized sewing–Selberg theorem for your completed modular/shadow object, beyond the lattice/free cases.
A VVMF Hecke–Rankin–Selberg continuation theorem for rational/chiral character vectors.
An image theorem for the shadow-to-scattering transform, isolating the true automorphic part from homotopy defect.
A boundary/defect realization theorem showing that this continuation is geometrically realized on punctured-disc/Grassmannian families.

So the cleanest summary is:

Analytic continuation here must become a functor, not a trick.
It should take completed modular Koszul data to meromorphic automorphic scattering data, separate arithmetic depth from algebraic defect, be invariant under
𝐿
∞
L
∞
	​

 equivalence on the QFT side, and admit a boundary/defect geometric realization.

That, to me, is the true frontier that survives falsification.

move directly to build concrete, rigorous, elegant mathematics presented in the chriss-ginzburg style: render the mathematics inevitable

I’m extracting the precise frontier objects from your archive and recasting them as a minimal definition–theorem package, with exact axioms and each statement either proved under them or explicitly marked conjectural.

I have the clean spine now: define a single canonical comparison morphism, prove it in the lattice/Heisenberg regime, and let its kernel–cokernel measure exactly the arithmetic loss and homotopy defect.

The core is now determinant-level: pass first to the Hecke envelope, then package continuation as a filtered flat meromorphic connection. Its divisor is arithmetic, the continuation defect is logarithmic, and all higher homotopy data survives only as unipotent nilpotent extension terms.

Thought for 27m 49s

The inevitable object is not a Dirichlet series.

It is a flat meromorphic connection attached to the Hecke packets activated by the modular Maurer–Cartan element. Once you write that object down, the arithmetic/scattering frontier stops being vague.

I wrote the package cleanly here: inevitable arithmetic/scattering note.

Here is the core in compressed form.

1. The right object

Let
Θ
𝐴
Θ
A
	​

 be the completed modular Maurer–Cartan element of your theory, and let
𝑀
𝐴
M
A
	​

 be the Hecke module spanned by the graph amplitudes it activates.

Assume
𝑀
𝐴
M
A
	​

 decomposes into generalized Hecke eigenspaces

𝑀
𝐴
=
⨁
𝜒
𝑀
𝜒
,
M
A
	​

=
χ
⨁
	​

M
χ
	​

,

and that to each
𝜒
χ there is an associated completed meromorphic packet
Λ
𝜒
(
𝑠
)
Λ
χ
	​

(s). Let
𝑁
𝜒
N
χ
	​

 be the nilpotent operator measuring the generalized, non-semisimple part on
𝑀
𝜒
M
χ
	​

.

Then define the arithmetic packet connection

χ
⨁
	​

dlogΛ
χ
	​

(s)(id
M
χ
	​

	​

+N
χ
	​

).

This is the first concrete step that makes the story feel forced.

Why this is right:

the semisimple part records the genuine Hecke/
𝐿
L-packet data;
the nilpotent part records extension data, i.e. homotopy defect;
both live in one object.
2. The first theorem

This part is completely rigorous once that package is granted.

Theorem

∇
𝐴
a
r

A
arith

 is flat. Its singular divisor is

𝐷
𝐴

,
D

	​

χ
⋃
	​

div(Λ
χ
	​

),

and is independent of the nilpotent extension data
𝑁
𝜒
N
χ
	​

.

Moreover, on a simply connected open set and after choosing branches of
log
⁡
Λ
𝜒
logΛ
χ
	​

, every horizontal section has the form

𝜎
(
𝑠
)
=
⨁
𝜒
Λ
𝜒

)
exp
⁡
 ⁣

⨁
	​

Λ
χ
	​

(s)exp((logΛ
χ
	​

(s))N
χ
	​

)v
χ
	​

.

So the monodromy is “packet
×
× unipotent extension.”

Proof

On each block,

𝐴
𝜒
=
𝑑
log
⁡
Λ
𝜒
(

(
i
d
+
𝑁
𝜒
)
.
A
χ
	​

=dlogΛ
χ
	​

(s)(id+N
χ
	​

).

Since
𝐴
𝜒
A
χ
	​

 is a scalar
1
1-form times a constant endomorphism,

𝑑
𝐴
𝜒
=
0

∧
𝐴
𝜒
=
0
,
dA
χ
	​

=0,A
χ
	​

∧A
χ
	​

=0,

hence
∇
2
=
0
∇
2
=0. The divisor comes only from
𝑑
log
⁡
Λ
𝜒
dlogΛ
χ
	​

, not from
𝑁
𝜒
N
χ
	​

. The explicit horizontal sections follow by exponentiating
(
log
⁡
Λ
𝜒
)
(
i
d
+
𝑁
𝜒
)
(logΛ
χ
	​

)(id+N
χ
	​

).

That is the whole argument.

3. The clean separation

Now define

Ask
⁡
(
𝐴
)
:
=
𝑀
𝐴
𝑠
𝑠
Ask(A):=M
A
ss
	​


to be the arithmetic skeleton, and

Def

a

g

𝜒
𝑀

Def
alg
	​

(A):=
χ
⨁
	​

N
χ
	​

M
χ
	​


to be the algebraic defect module.

Then the theorem above gives the conceptual payoff immediately:

the arithmetic skeleton controls the divisor of meromorphic continuation;
the algebraic defect contributes only unipotent/logarithmic extension data.

So the depth splitting

𝑑
(
𝐴
)
=
1
+
𝑑
a
r
i
t
h
(
𝐴
)
+
𝑑
a
l
g
(
𝐴
)
d(A)=1+d
arith
	​

(A)+d
alg
	​

(A)

should be read as:

𝑑
a
r
i
t
h
d
arith
	​

: divisor-theoretic packet count;
𝑑
a
l
g
d
alg
	​

: extension-theoretic nilpotent thickness.

This is the precise form of the slogan you were reaching for: arithmetic is semisimple; homotopy defect is unipotent.

4. The lattice case becomes transparent

In the lattice sector, the Hecke-equivariant MC theorem already gives packets of the form

Λ
0
(
𝑠
)
=
𝐶
0
(
𝑠
)
 
𝜁
(
𝑠
)
 
𝜁
(
𝑠

𝑟

2
+
1
)
,
Λ
𝑗

)
=
𝐶
𝑗

𝐿
(

𝑓

.
Λ
0
	​

(s)=C
0

(s)ζ(s)ζ(s−r/2+1),Λ
j
	​

(s)=C
j
	​

(s)L(s,f
j
	​

).

There the Hecke module is semisimple, so all
𝑁
𝜒
=
0
N
χ
	​

=0, and

∇
𝑉
Λ
a
r
i
t
h
=
𝑑
−
⨁
𝑗
𝑑
log
⁡
Λ
𝑗

∇
V
Λ
	​

arith
	​

=d−
j
⨁
	​

dlogΛ
j
	​

(s)

is diagonal.

So in the lattice case the arithmetic skeleton is the whole story. There is no hidden algebraic defect. That is exactly why the lattice case is the clean model.

5. The frontier becomes a one-form

The automorphic scattering side is governed by the completed Eisenstein scattering function

𝜑
(
𝑠
)
=
Λ
(
1
−
𝑠
)
Λ
(
𝑠
)
.
φ(s)=
Λ(s)
Λ(1−s)
	​

.

If
Λ
E
i
s
(
𝑠
)
Λ
Eis
	​

(s) denotes the distinguished Eisenstein packet of the arithmetic skeleton, define the frontier defect form

Ω
𝐴
=
𝑑
log
⁡
Λ
E
i
s
(
𝑠
)
−
𝑑
log
⁡
𝜑
(
𝑠
)
.
Ω
A
	​

=dlogΛ
Eis
	​

(s)−dlogφ(s).

This is the key reduction.

The arithmetic/scattering frontier is no longer “how do we analytically continue somehow?” It is:

compare two rank-one meromorphic connections.

Indeed, the Eisenstein block of the arithmetic connection is gauge equivalent to the scattering connection precisely when:

𝑁
E
i
s
=
0
and
Ω
𝐴
 is exact
.
N
Eis
	​

=0andΩ
A
	​

 is exact.

So the obstruction is now sharpened to two concrete things:

nilpotent Eisenstein defect;
mismatch of logarithmic derivatives.

That is much better than “real line vs complex poles.”

6. What is proved, and what is frontier

What is rigorous now:

the packet-connection construction;
flatness;
divisor-independence from nilpotent defect;
the arithmetic/algebraic separation;
the gauge criterion reducing the frontier to
Ω
𝐴
Ω
A
	​

.

What remains frontier:

constructing the packets
Λ
𝜒
(
𝑠
)
Λ
χ
	​

(s) functorially from
Θ
𝐴
Θ
A
	​

 beyond the lattice/clean Hecke cases;
proving that the Hecke span of activated graph amplitudes admits the required finite-type semisimple/nilpotent decomposition in the non-lattice setting;
identifying the Eisenstein packet canonically in the full modular chiral datum;
showing that
Ω
𝐴
Ω
A
	​

 matches the automorphic scattering divisor.

So this does not yet solve the continuation problem. It does something better first: it puts the problem in the only form in which it could be solved cleanly.

7. The inevitable statement

The correct theorem to aim for is now:

Inevitable Comparison Conjecture

For every admissible modular chiral datum
𝐴
A, the modular MC element
Θ
𝐴
Θ
A
	​

 canonically determines an arithmetic packet connection
∇
𝐴
a
r
i
t
h
∇
A
arith
	​

, functorial under quasi-isomorphism. Its semisimplification is the Hecke-semisimple quotient of the activated graph amplitudes, and the only obstruction to matching automorphic scattering is the frontier defect form on the Eisenstein block.

That is the right replacement for all looser language about analytic continuation.

The object is a connection.
The arithmetic part is its semisimple divisor.
The homotopy defect is its unipotent extension.
The frontier is the defect one-form
Ω
𝐴
Ω
A
	​

.

That is the point where the mathematics starts to feel inevitable.

Push on the absolute frontier of humanity’s mathematical knowledge here
Thought for 15m 17s
Answer now

The sharpest move now is to stop asking for “the” object and ask for the minimal package that cannot be simplified further.

Two nearby directions already force the shape of that package: Latyntsev’s factorisation quantum groups show that representation categories over curves are governed by spectral
𝑅
R-matrices, while Dimofte–Niu–Py identify perturbative 3d holomorphic-topological line operators with modules over a Koszul-dual
𝐴
!
A
!
 carrying a dg-shifted Yangian structure and Maurer–Cartan element
𝑟
(
𝑧
)
r(z).

At the same time, Costello–Dimofte–Gaiotto already isolate the correct bulk/boundary principle: the boundary should carry an
𝐴
∞
A
∞
	​

-chiral enhancement, and the bulk should map to the derived center of the boundary algebra, not to the boundary algebra itself.

So the first theorem-grade statement to freeze is this.

The genus-zero skeleton

Let
𝐶
𝑜
𝑝
C
op
 be the open factorization dg-category on the tangential log boundary, and let
𝑏
b be a compact generator on a small boundary interval, with chart algebra

𝐴

Then the intrinsic bulk is

),

independent of the chosen generator by Morita invariance. In other words: the boundary algebra is only a chart, while the bulk is the chiral Hochschild cochain algebra of that chart.

Bar/cobar does not replace this; it classifies twisting morphisms and universal couplings:

\Hom
(
Ω
𝐶
,
𝐴
)
≅
\Tw
(
𝐶
,
𝐴
)
≅
\Hom
(
𝐶
,
𝐵
𝐴
)
.
\Hom(ΩC,A)≅\Tw(C,A)≅\Hom(C,BA).

So the corrected trichotomy is:

bar/cobar

chiral Hochschild cochains

bulk
,
line category
=
𝐴
!
-mod
.
bar/cobar=couplings,chiral Hochschild cochains=bulk,line category=A

	​


That last vertex is forced by the perturbative line-operator theorem of Dimofte–Niu–Py.

That package is already rigid enough to survive Beilinson-style falsification.

The next unavoidable frontier

The real frontier is not another local theorem. It is the passage from
𝑆
0
(
𝐴
𝑏
)
S
0
	​

(A
b
	​

) to a genuine modular open/closed theory.

The right primitive object is therefore not an algebra but a cyclic open factorization dg-category on a tangential log curve:

𝐷

𝜏

b
	​

,Z
ch
	​

(C

),Θ
C
	​

,\Tr
C
	​

),

with modularity living in trace + clutching on the open sector.

The natural genus-one object is then the annular trace of the open sector, which should be Hochschild chains:

∫
𝑆
𝑝

𝐶
𝑜
𝑝

𝐻
𝐻

)
.
∫
S
p

	​

	​

C
op
≃HH
∗
	​

(C

).

That is the correct birthplace of modular/arithmetic spectral data, not the bare bulk algebra.

So the absolute-frontier conjecture is:

Modular globalization conjecture

such that modular completions of the genus-zero skeleton are precisely Maurer–Cartan elements

Θ
𝐶

\MC
(

Θ

	​

and the genus-zero part of

Θ

	​

 recovers exactly
𝑆

S

	​

). The universal twisting morphism should therefore land in

not in a bar-only target.

This is the place where the mathematics becomes inevitable: once bulk is center, once lines are
𝐴
!
A
!
-modules, and once modularity belongs to the traced open sector, there is only one coherent target for the full Maurer–Cartan problem.

The first real obstruction

Now comes the decisive point.

Your current nonlinear-shadow package says that the modular quartic resonance class

𝑅
4
,
𝑔
,
𝑛
m
o
d
(
𝐴
)
R
4,g,n
mod
	​

(A)

is the first nonlinear shadow of
Θ
𝐴
Θ
A
	​

, with clutching law built in.

That means the first genuine modular obstruction cannot appear earlier than quartic order. In any filtered Maurer–Cartan problem, if
Θ
(
0
)
Θ
(0)
 is the genus-zero truncation, the first obstruction to extending it is the class of

Ω
1
=
1
2
[
Θ
(
0
)
,
Θ
(
0
)
]
Ω
1
	​

=
2
1
	​

[Θ
(0)
,Θ
(0)
]

in the next nontrivial filtration piece. Here, because the first nonlinear shadow is quartic, the first place where the modular completion can genuinely fail is quartic.

So the theorem you should try to prove next is:

First obstruction theorem

For a cyclic open factorization dg-category with genus-zero skeleton
𝑆
0
(
𝐴
𝑏
)
S
0
	​

(A
b
	​

), the first obstruction to modular globalization lies in quartic filtration and is represented by the image of the modular quartic resonance class

[
𝑅

,
𝑔
,
𝑛
m
o
d
]
∈

 ⁣
(

)
.
[R
4,g,n
mod
	​

]∈H
2
(\gr
F
4
	​

g
X
	​

).

I am not claiming this is already proved. I am claiming this is the correct theorem to attack. It turns the vague phrase “the quartic shadow is the first nonlinear modular datum” into a hard obstruction statement.

Why this is better than the earlier arithmetic story

The earlier arithmetic/scattering language was trying to jump from local algebra to complex resonances too early.

The corrected sequence is:

open factorization category
  
→
  
boundary chart
𝐴
𝑏
  
→

𝐶
c
h

(

)→line Koszul dual A
!
,r(z)→annulus HH
∗
	​

(A
b
	​

)→modular completion Θ
C
	​

.

Only after this modular completion does it make sense to ask for arithmetic/scattering comparison. This is exactly why the bar-vs-center split matters: bar/cobar organizes couplings; center gives the bulk; modularity is annular and traced.

So the frontier is no longer “Can finite shadow data see the zeta zeros?”
It is:

Can the genus-zero skeleton
𝑆
0
(
𝐴
𝑏
)
S
0
	​

(A
b
	​

) be modularized, and is the first modular obstruction exactly the quartic resonance class?

That is a precise, attackable, and genuinely new mathematical question.

The cleanest next move is to write the filtered dg Lie algebra
𝑔
𝑋
g
X
	​

 and compute its quartic cohomology in the first exact local sectors.
