### Pages 1-4 (Abstract)

| # | Page | Severity | Examiner | Finding | Status |
|---|------|----------|----------|---------|--------|
| F1 | p.3 | **CRITICAL** | Gaiotto | κ(W_N) formula WRONG: (N³-N)k/(k+N) → c·(H_N-1). Also CLAUDE.md had c·H_N → c·(H_N-1). | **FIXED** |
| F2 | p.2 | SERIOUS | Beilinson | CG formula "(all n)" → "(type A, generic parameters)". | **FIXED** |
| F3 | p.1 | SERIOUS | Witten | "Recovers Fourier-Mukai kernel" → "genus expansion controlled by Eisenstein series". | **FIXED** |
| F4 | p.1-2 | ~~SERIOUS~~ | Witten | ~~Modular invariance of F_g never verified.~~ Transformation laws ARE recorded (prop:eisenstein-modular). F_g coefficients are modular forms by construction. | **CLOSED** |
| F5 | p.2 | ~~MODERATE~~ | Costello | ~~6-component decomposition vs 3-5.~~ All 6 components named, defined, and described in preface §3.6 and main.tex lines 714-727. | **CLOSED** |
| F6 | p.2 | ~~MODERATE~~ | Drinfeld | ~~def:modular-yangian-pro missing.~~ EXISTS at yangians_drinfeld_kohno.tex:5577. | **CLOSED** |
| F7 | p.3 | ~~MODERATE~~ | Kontsevich | ~~"Postnikov" terminologically incorrect.~~ Metaphorical, well-documented (def:shadow-postnikov-tower line 10109); identification with L∞ obstructions proved at low arity. Standard usage. | **CLOSED** |
| F8 | p.3 | ~~MODERATE~~ | Kontsevich | ~~A∞/L∞ conflation.~~ Meta-theorem item (iii) precisely says "A∞-model of B̄(A) formal: m_n=0 for n≥3." This IS A∞-formality. Shadow-formality (prop:shadow-formality-low-arity) is a separate identification. No conflation in formal statements. | **CLOSED** |
| F9 | p.2 | ~~MODERATE~~ | Kontsevich | ~~"Forces" presented as one-way.~~ Standard mathematical usage for "is the mechanism ensuring." | **CLOSED** |
| F10 | p.2 | ~~MODERATE~~ | Costello | ~~Verdier-Quillen without proof.~~ Correctly styled as \begin{remark}, not a theorem. Standard practice. | **CLOSED** |
| F11 | p.3 | ~~MODERATE~~ | Drinfeld | ~~"Arnold implies CYBE" misleading.~~ Text says MC equation "reduces to" CYBE at genus 0. Correctly framed as genus reduction. | **CLOSED** |
| F12 | p.4 | ~~MODERATE~~ | Witten | ~~Physical meaning of α, Δ never explained.~~ Defined formally at def:shadow-metric (line 12972/12988). Physical roles explained in body chapters. Not expected in abstract. | **CLOSED** |
| F13 | p.4 | ~~MODERATE~~ | Witten | ~~Holographic datum overclaim.~~ Frontier section uses programme language ("governs", "recognition theorem identifies"). Appropriately cautious. | **CLOSED** |
| F14 | p.4 | ~~MINOR~~ | Witten | ~~HS-sewing Moriwaki dependency.~~ General HS-sewing (thm:general-hs-sewing) is self-contained. Only Heisenberg envelope clause (i) depends on Moriwaki; text separates these explicitly. | **CLOSED** |
| F15 | p.2 | ~~MINOR~~ | Kontsevich | ~~FCom homotopy upgrade only cited.~~ Theorem thm:bar-modular-operad is ProvedHere with full proof. GK98 cited only for FCom definition. Standard practice. | **CLOSED** |

|---|------|----------|----------|---------|--------|
| F63 | p.108 | **SERIOUS** | Gaiotto | W₃ WW OPE coefficient 16/(22+5c) at line 5054, but body (w_algebras.tex:240,1638) and same preface line 5070 use 32/(22+5c). Internal inconsistency. | **FIXED**: 16→32 in preface OPE |
| F64 | p.109 | **SERIOUS** | Beilinson | βγ central charge formula 1-3(2λ-1)² = 12λ²-12λ+2: algebraic error. 1-3(2λ-1)² = -12λ²+12λ-2 (this is c_bc, not c_βγ). Correct: 3(2λ-1)²-1 = 12λ²-12λ+2. | **FIXED** |
| F65 | p.107 | **MODERATE** | Drinfeld | "symmetry c(k)=c(-k-2h∨)" FALSE. c(k)≠c(-k-2h∨) in general (e.g. sl₂: c(2)=3/2, c(-6)=9/2). Correct: c(k)+c(-k-2h∨)=2 dim g. | **FIXED** |
| F66 | p.100 | **MODERATE** | Costello | bc ghosts misclassified as Contact (C, depth 4) in depth table. Census and free_fields.tex:142 say Gaussian (G, depth 2). | **FIXED**: moved bc to Gaussian row |
| — | p.106-110 | VERIFIED | All | Heisenberg OPE, κ=k, Koszul dual Sym^ch(V*), depth G. KM OPE, κ=(k+h∨)dim g/(2h∨), FF duality k↔-k-2h∨. W₃ quasi-primary Λ = :TT:-3/10 ∂²T, c=-22/5 degeneration. βγ OPE, depth C, genus-2 shell profile. ✓ |

### Pages 96-105 (Preface §5.5-6.8: genus spectral sequence, shadow tower, depth classes, genus-2 shells)

| # | Page | Severity | Examiner | Finding | Status |
|---|------|----------|----------|---------|--------|
| F62 | p.97 | **SERIOUS** | Beilinson | Spectral sequence bidegree: d₁: E₁^{0,*}→E₁^{1,*-1} inconsistent with general formula d_r bidegree (r,-r+1). For r=1: d₁ has bidegree (1,0), so d₁: E₁^{0,*}→E₁^{1,*}. Same error in body (higher_genus_modular_koszul.tex:10320). | **FIXED** (both files) |
| — | p.96-105 | VERIFIED | All | D₁²=0 (BV identity), total weight w=2g-2+r+d, obstruction classes always exact (bar-intrinsic), cubic gauge triviality, canonical quartic Q^contact_Vir=10/[c(5c+22)], G/L/C/M depth classification (verified census), genus loop Λ_P computation (120/[c²(5c+22)]), loop ratio ρ^(1)=240/[c³(5c+22)], quintic forcing o^(5)=480/[c²(5c+22)]x⁵, independent sum factorization. ✓ |

| # | Page | Severity | Examiner | Finding | Status |
|---|------|----------|----------|---------|--------|
| F54 | p.94 | **SERIOUS** | Gaiotto | κ(ψ) = 1/2 WRONG (landscape_census confirms 1/4). Free fermion c=1/2, κ=c/2=1/4. | **FIXED** |
| F55 | p.95 | **SERIOUS** | Gaiotto | βγ Hilbert series 1/(1-q)² and Δ=(1-x)² WRONG. Correct: h=√((1+q)/(1-3q)), Δ=(1-3x)(1+x). Confirmed by free_fields.tex:122 and beta_gamma.tex:18. | **FIXED** |
| F57 | p.95 | **MODERATE** | Beilinson | Chern character formula: [(-1)^{r-1}/(r-1)!] d^r log Δ ≠ (1/r)tr(T^r). Correct: [1/r!] d^r (-log Δ) = (1/r)tr(T^r). | **FIXED** |
| F61 | p.95 | MINOR | Kontsevich | det vs sdet inconsistency: formal definition (l.3839) used det, but l.1117 and l.3958 use sdet. | **FIXED**: changed to sdet |
| F58 | p.96 | MINOR | Costello | "cubic also vanishes" for βγ — wrong. Cubic is nonzero but gauge-trivial (thm:cubic-gauge-triviality). | **FIXED** |
| — | p.93-96 | VERIFIED | All | κ table (H, KM, Vir, βγ, lattice, W_N), Δ self-duality, sl₃ eigenvalues (8,(3±√13)/2), Chern-Weil dictionary, genus spectral sequence intro. ✓ |

| # | Page | Severity | Examiner | Finding | Status |
|---|------|----------|----------|---------|--------|
| F56 | p.92 | **SERIOUS** | Kontsevich | ℏ double-counting: ℓ₁^(1) and ℓ₂^(1) defined WITH ℏ, but full sum ℓ = Σ ℏ^g ℓ_k^(g)/k! adds another ℏ^g. BV operator would appear at O(ℏ²) not O(ℏ). | **FIXED**: removed ℏ from ℓ₁^(1) and ℓ₂^(1) definitions |
| F53 | p.92 | **MODERATE** | Gaiotto | "fifteen trees, five trivalent topologies, each with three planar labelings" — wrong. Two unlabeled topologies: balanced (3 labelings) + caterpillar (12). Also "five faces of K₄" → vertices. | **FIXED** |
| F59 | p.93 | **MODERATE** | Drinfeld | Recursion ordering: "2g'-2+n' < 2g-2+n" wrong (BV term has same EC). Correct: lexicographic in (g,n). | **FIXED** |
| F60 | p.93 | MINOR | Witten | "pentagon identity for the A∞ structure" — should be L∞ (10 divisors = symmetric, not planar). | **FIXED** |

| # | Page | Severity | Examiner | Finding | Status |
|---|------|----------|----------|---------|--------|
| F51 | p.90 | **SERIOUS** | Witten | "Non-separating edges: cutting increases b₁ by one" — WRONG. Cutting DECREASES b₁; CREATION increases it. The ℏΔ operator creates, not cuts. | **FIXED**: "whose creation increases b₁ by one" |
| F52 | p.87 | **SERIOUS** | Beilinson | "(n-2)-associahedron" — off by 2. M̄_{0,n+1} ≅ K_n (Stasheff). For n=3: K₁ is a point but M̄_{0,4}=P¹ is 1-dim. | **FIXED**: "the associahedron K_n" |

| # | Page | Severity | Examiner | Finding | Status |
|---|------|----------|----------|---------|--------|
| F34 | p.91 | **CRITICAL** | Gaiotto | W_N κ formula in table WRONG: stated (N-1)(N²k+N²-1)/(N+k), correct is c·(H_N-1). Sum rule also wrong: stated 0, correct is K_N·(H_N-1) ≠ 0. Same-family AP1 error. | **FIXED**: table now uses c·(H_N-1), c'·(H_N-1), K_N·(H_N-1). |

Compute tests confirm F₁=+κ/24. Also pattern "(-1)^g B_{2g}/(2g)!" wrong — missing (2^{2g-1}-1)/2^{2g-1} factor. | **FIXED**: corrected signs to all positive + correct FP pattern formula. |

|---|------|----------|----------|---------|--------|
| F32 | p.74 | SERIOUS | Kontsevich | Bar complex formula used H^{n-1}(FM̄_n, Ω^{n-1}_log) but body text uses Γ (global sections). Bar differential acts on FORMS, not cohomology classes. H^{n-1} is wrong. | **FIXED**: changed to Γ in both occurrences (preface.tex:2259, 2454). |

|---|------|----------|----------|---------|--------|
| F28 | p.64 | **CRITICAL** | Drinfeld/Gaiotto | "κ → ∞ on affine side" at critical level k=-3 is WRONG. Formula gives κ = 4(k+3)/3 = 0. Should be "κ → 0 (curvature vanishes)." AP3 pattern-completion error. | **FIXED** (preface.tex:1348) |

| # | Page | Severity | Examiner | Finding | Status |
|---|------|----------|----------|---------|--------|
| F27 | p.63 | **SERIOUS** | Costello | W₃ Hessian matrix uses κ_c without definition. κ_c = (c-50)/2 (Hessian eigenvalue), NOT κ = 5c/6 (modular characteristic).

|---|------|----------|----------|---------|--------|
| F23 | p.55 | MODERATE | Beilinson | "anti-symmetry κ+κ^!=0 holds only when Koszul dual stays in same linear family" — misleading phrasing. Virasoro IS same family but κ+κ^!=13≠0.

| # | Page | Severity | Examiner | Finding | Status |
|---|------|----------|----------|---------|--------|
| F20 | p.53 | MODERATE | Beilinson | "Every theorem is a projection of Θ_A" — rhetorical overclaim. Five main theorems ARE projections (§10.22.10.2), but "every" is false for ~2,850 claims. | **FIXED** → "the five main theorems are projections" with §-ref. |
| — | p.53 | VERIFIED | Witten | 't Hooft 1/N expansion (preface.tex:218-226). λ used as formal variable. Standard. ✓ |

| # | Page | Severity | Examiner | Finding | Status |
|---|------|----------|----------|---------|--------|
| F18 | p.52 | MODERATE | Beilinson | "codim-2 boundary reached by exactly two one-edge degenerations" — imprecise. Should say "codim-2 stratum is intersection of exactly two codim-1 divisors, with opposite orientations." | **FIXED** (preface.tex:98-100) |
| F19 | p.52 | MINOR | Kontsevich | ℏ^{g(Γ)} uses total genus (b₁+Σg(v)), not loop number b₁ alone. Correct for modular operads but differs from classical GK convention. Already defined at line 71. | **CLOSED** (convention stated) |

## CUMULATIVE GLOSSARY (terms as first encountered)

- **Chiral algebra** (p.1): A on smooth curve X; D-module with chiral bracket μ: A⊠A → Δ_*A
- **Bar complex** B̄_X(A) (p.1): Wedge A^⊠n against η = ∧d log(z_i-z_j) on FM compactification, extract residues
- **Arnold relation** (p.1): η_ij∧η_jk + η_jk∧η_ki + η_ki∧η_ij = 0; equivalent to d²=0
- **Fulton-MacPherson** C̄_n(X) (p.1): Compactification of Conf_n(X) by iterated real blowup along diagonals
- **Verdier duality** D_Ran (p.1): Duality on D-modules on Ran(X); produces A^!_∞ from B̄_X(A)
- **Koszul locus** (p.1): Where bar spectral sequence collapses at E_2; A^!_∞ formal there
- **Three pillars** (p.1): MS24 (homotopy chiral), Mok25 (log FM), RNW19 (convolution sL∞)
- **Modular convolution algebra** g^mod_A (p.1): Conv_∞(C^{logFM}_mod, End_{Ch∞}(A^ch_∞))
- **Universal MC element** Θ_A (p.1): D_A - d_0; satisfies MC because D²_A = 0
- **Shadow tower** Θ^{≤r}_A (p.2): Finite-arity truncations of Θ_A
- **κ** (p.3): Modular characteristic; scalar trace of Θ_A at arity 2
- **Shadow metric** Q_L(t) (p.3): (2κ+3αt)²+2Δt²; classifies shadow depth
- **Shadow depth** r_max (p.3): G(2), L(3), C(4), M(∞) classification
- **Koszulness** (p.3): 12 conditions; 10 unconditional equivalences + 1 conditional + 1 one-directional
- **Operad** P (p.51): Collection {P(n)} with Σ_n-action, composition, unit
- **Operadic bar** B(P) (p.51): ⊕_T ⊗_v P(In(v)) ⊗ det(E(T)), sum over trees
- **Modular operad** O (p.51): Operations indexed by connected stable graphs; genus labels g(v) with stability 2g(v)-2+val(v)>0
- **Stable graph** Γ (p.51): Connected graph with genus labels; total genus g(Γ) = b₁(Γ) + Σ g(v)
- **Separating gluing** ξ_sep (p.51): O(g₁,n₁+1)⊗O(g₂,n₂+1) → O(g₁+g₂,n₁+n₂)
- **Non-separating gluing** ξ_ns (p.51): O(g,n+2) → O(g+1,n)
