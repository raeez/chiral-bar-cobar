Koszul dual Hilbert series computation.

Computes bar cohomology dimensions via the Koszul dual coalgebra
Hilbert series, given generators and quadratic OPE relations.

This is the CORRECT computational approach for bar cohomology:
- The bracket-only bar differential does NOT square to zero
- The PBW criterion (Theorem thm:pbw-koszulness-criterion) reduces
  chiral Koszulness to classical Koszulness of the associated graded
- Bar cohomology = Koszul dual Hilbert series (Corollary cor:bar-cohomology-koszul-dual)

For a quadratic algebra A = T(V)/(R) with R ⊂ V⊗V:
- The Koszul dual coalgebra A^! = T^c(V*) / (R^⊥)
- dim (A^!)_n can be computed iteratively
- If A is Koszul: H_A(t) * H_{A!}(-t) = 1

def sl2_relations():
    """
    Quadratic relations for sl₂ current algebra (bracket part only).

    Generators: e, f, h (indices 0, 1, 2), so d=3.
    The bracket relations [e,f]=h, [h,e]=2e, [h,f]=-2f give:

    In V⊗V (9-dimensional), the relations are:
    e⊗f - f⊗e = h  (in the quotient, this becomes e⊗f - f⊗e - h⊗1...

    Actually for the bar complex, the "quadratic relations" come from
    the degree-2 bar differential d: B^2 → B^1.
    B^2 = V⊗V (with OS form, but dim OS^1 = 1 for 2 points).
    d([a|b]) = [a,b] (the bracket).

    The relations in the quadratic dual are: R = image(bracket map) ⊂ V.
    Wait, that's the wrong direction. Let me think again.

    For the bar construction of a Lie algebra g:
    - B^1 = g, B^2 = g⊗g (with the OS form)
    - d: B^2 → B^1 sends a⊗b → [a,b]
    - The "quadratic data" is the bracket map μ: V⊗V → V

    The Koszul dual of U(g) (as a quadratic algebra T(g)/(ab-ba-[a,b])):
    - Relations R ⊂ g⊗g: span{a⊗b - b⊗a - [a,b]}
    - R^⊥ ⊂ g*⊗g*: the annihilator

    For sl₂: g = span{e,f,h}, the relations are:
    r1 = e⊗f - f⊗e - h    (but h is in V, not V⊗V)

    Hmm, this is the universal enveloping algebra U(g) = T(g)/(a⊗b - b⊗a - [a,b]).
    The relations live in T²(g) ⊕ T¹(g) (they have quadratic AND linear parts).
    This means U(g) is NOT a strictly quadratic algebra — it's "almost quadratic"
    (inhomogeneous quadratic).

    For the PBW-associated graded: gr U(g) = Sym(g), which IS quadratic
    (relations: a⊗b - b⊗a, purely quadratic).

    So for the Koszul dual computation, we should use the COMMUTATOR relations
    R = span{a⊗b - b⊗a : a,b ∈ g} ⊂ g⊗g.
    These are the antisymmetric tensors Λ²(g).
    R^⊥ = S²(g*) (symmetric tensors).

    dim R = C(3,2) = 3, dim R^⊥ = C(3+1,2) = 6.

    But this gives the Koszul dual of Sym(g), which is Λ(g*).
    That has dims [1, 3, 3, 1, 0, 0, ...] — NOT the Riordan numbers!

    The Riordan numbers come from the CHIRAL bar complex, not the classical one.
    The chiral bar complex has more structure (the OS forms add combinatorial data).
