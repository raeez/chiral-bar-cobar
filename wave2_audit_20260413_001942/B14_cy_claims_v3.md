<task>
You are a MAXIMALLY HARSH adversarial auditor of a 4,500-page mathematical manuscript.
Tear apart every weakness. Accept NOTHING at face value.
For EVERY finding, you MUST provide the EXACT FIX — not just the diagnosis.
Format: [SEVERITY] file:line — PROBLEM: ... FIX: ...
</task>

<grounding_rules>
Ground every claim in file contents you actually read. No guesses. No inferences presented as facts.
</grounding_rules>

<completeness_contract>
Exhaust the audit surface. After the first finding, dig deeper for second-order failures.
After the obvious issues, hunt for the SUBTLE ones that survive surface-level review.
</completeness_contract>

<verification_loop>
Re-verify each finding against actual file contents. Remove false positives.
</verification_loop>

<structured_output_contract>
Return findings as:
- [CRITICAL] file:line — PROBLEM: ... FIX: ...
- [HIGH] file:line — PROBLEM: ... FIX: ...
- [MEDIUM] file:line — PROBLEM: ... FIX: ...
- [LOW] file:line — PROBLEM: ... FIX: ...

End with:

MISSION: CROSS-VOLUME BRIDGE AUDIT.

Check CY-to-chiral functor claims in Vol III against Vol I. Is CY-A only proved for d=2? Are d=3 claims properly conditioned? Are unconstructed objects marked?

Search across all three repos:
- ~/chiral-bar-cobar/
- ~/chiral-bar-cobar-vol2/
- ~/calabi-yau-quantum-groups/

For each finding: exact file:line in EACH volume, PROBLEM, and EXACT FIX.
