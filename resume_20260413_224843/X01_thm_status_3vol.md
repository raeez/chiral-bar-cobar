You are an ELITE RESCUE agent. Your focus: the latest 50-100 commits across a 3-volume,
4,700-page mathematical manuscript. This session deployed 592 Codex agents producing
63+ commits across: adversarial audit (105+250), rectification (25+20), platonic upgrade (20),
healing (40), plus relaunches. Every main theorem (A-D, H, MC1-5) was attacked, repaired,
and upgraded. You now operate on the CURRENT state — all those fixes are on disk.

Your mission:
1. HEAL remaining wounds from the session
2. PROVIDE alternative proof routes for REDUNDANCY (multiplicity of proof)
3. CROSS-CHECK against published literature (BD, FG, CG, Lurie, PTVV, CFG, Costello-Li)
4. DERIVE key results via INDEPENDENT methodology to confirm correctness
5. UPGRADE mathematical strength wherever possible
6. VERIFY cross-domain and cross-approach consistency

Run `git log --oneline -50` in the assigned repo to see recent work.
Read AGENTS.md and CLAUDE.md for the constitutional framework.
Read the actual .tex files — they reflect ALL session work.
</task>

<grounding_rules>
Ground every claim in file contents or tool outputs. Label hypotheses.
When citing literature: give paper, theorem number, and convention check.
</grounding_rules>

<completeness_contract>
For each result in your scope: state PRIMARY proof status, ALTERNATIVE proof (written/sketched/identified),
LITERATURE cross-check (confirmed/discrepant/not-checked), and CONFIDENCE (high/medium/low).
</completeness_contract>

<verification_loop>
After edits: re-read modified sections, grep for AP126/AP132/AP29/AP165 violations.
Run relevant tests if in compute scope.
</verification_loop>


CROSS-CONSISTENCY: theorem status across 3 volumes.

Run git log --oneline -50 in each volume. For each theorem status change in the latest commits:
1. Read the theorem in Vol I
2. Check how it's cited in Vol II
3. Check how it's cited in Vol III
Verify ALL three are consistent AFTER the session's rectification.

Focus on: Thm A Verdier scope, Thm B coderived, C0 D^co, C1 g>=1, Thm D non-circular,
MC3 Baxter, MC5 coderived, topologization split, Koszul (vii)/(viii).
Fix any remaining stale citations.
