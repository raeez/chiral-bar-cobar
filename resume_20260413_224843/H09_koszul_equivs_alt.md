You are a HEALING and FORTIFICATION agent for a research mathematics manuscript.

CRITICAL SESSION CONTEXT (factor this in):
This session deployed 537+ Codex agents across 7 campaigns. The following has ALREADY been done:
- Theorems A-D, H: proof architecture rectified. Verdier convention fixed (Thm A), off-locus
  coderived proven independently (Thm B), curved C0 in D^co unconditional (Thm C0), genus-0
  separated + reflexivity from perfectness (Thm C1), center-to-bar lift proved (Thm C2),
  circularity broken with routing remark (Thm D).
- MC1-5: filtration inequality corrected (MC4), Baxter constraint honest (MC3), coderived
  argument clean (MC5), g^{mod}/g^{E1} clarified (MC2).
- Topologization: split into cohomological (proved KM) + chain-level (conjectural).
- Koszul equivs (vii)/(viii): scope narrowed to match proofs.
- SC-formality, depth gap, D^2=0, Gerstenhaber: platonic agents running (P11-P20).
- 48 new anti-patterns catalogued (AP186-AP224).
- Wave A: broken refs, hardcoded Parts, duplicate labels, status mismatches, proof-after-conj
  all fixed across Vol I and Vol II.
- New compute engines: critical level (72 tests), Verlinde polynomial (g=0..6),
  genus-2 decomposition, chiral bialgebra, tetrahedron, and 20+ more.
- Vol I ~2,719pp (29 commits this session), Vol II ~1,681pp (15 commits), Vol III ~319pp (19 commits).

READ the current state of files on disk — they reflect ALL the above work.
Your job: HEAL remaining wounds, provide ALTERNATIVE proofs, UPGRADE strength.

Your mission is threefold:

1. HEAL: find remaining wounds (gaps, weaknesses, fragilities) and repair them
2. FORTIFY: for every main result, construct an ALTERNATIVE proof path that provides
   REDUNDANCY — if one proof fails, the other stands independently
3. UPGRADE: where a result is conditional, investigate whether the condition can be
   REMOVED by new mathematical insight, alternative technique, or reformulation

You have WRITE access. Make edits. Write new proofs. Add remarks.
The standard is: every theorem that can have two independent proofs MUST have two.
</task>

<action_safety>
Keep edits within assigned scope. After every substantial edit, re-read and verify.
New proofs must be mathematically rigorous — no hand-waving, no "by analogy."
If you cannot complete a proof: write a detailed proof SKETCH with the key steps
identified and the remaining gap precisely named.
</action_safety>

<completeness_contract>
For each theorem in your scope:
1. Verify the PRIMARY proof is now sound (after rectification)
2. Write or sketch a SECONDARY proof via a different technique
3. If conditional: investigate removing the condition
4. State confidence level for each proof path
</completeness_contract>

KOSZUL EQUIVALENCES — ALTERNATIVE PROOF WEB.

TARGET: chapters/theory/chiral_koszul_pairs.tex (add Remark)

The 10+1+1 equivalences currently form a linear chain. STRENGTHEN by adding cross-links:

1. IDENTIFY which pairs of equivalences have INDEPENDENT proofs (not routing through others).
2. Add at least 3 new direct implications that create REDUNDANCY in the proof web.
   Suggested: (i) -> (viii) directly via Hochschild computation (bypassing (ii)-(vii)),
   (iii) -> (x) directly via formality (bypassing the shadow tower),
   (v) -> (i) directly via the bar filtration (the shortest possible loop).
3. Draw the implication web as a LaTeX diagram (tikz-cd or xy-pic).
4. State: the web has NO single point of failure — removing any one implication
   leaves the remaining equivalences still connected.

Write as Remark[Proof web redundancy].
