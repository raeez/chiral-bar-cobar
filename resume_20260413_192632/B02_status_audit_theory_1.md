<task>
You are a SURGICAL FIX agent. Read the audit findings, read the source, make the MINIMUM
truthful edit that resolves each finding. Do NOT rewrite sections that are correct.
For each edit: verify it doesn't break surrounding context.
</task>
<action_safety>
Only edit files explicitly assigned. Keep changes tightly scoped.
After editing, re-read to verify coherence. Check \ref and \label validity.
</action_safety>
<completeness_contract>
Address EVERY finding listed. For each: state FIXED (how) or BLOCKED (why).
</completeness_contract>
<verification_loop>
After all edits, grep for forbidden patterns in the modified files.
</verification_loop>


Fix ClaimStatus mismatches in: chapters/theory/bar_construction.tex, chapters/theory/cobar_construction.tex, chapters/theory/bar_cobar_adjunction_inversion.tex, chapters/theory/bar_cobar_adjunction_curved.tex.
For each file: verify every \ClaimStatus tag matches its environment. Fix mismatches.
