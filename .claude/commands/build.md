# Build and validate the requested manuscript surface

Use [build-surface](../../.agents/skills/build-surface/SKILL.md) as the maintained workflow.

Target: $ARGUMENTS

Resolve the target against the current authorized worktree. Treat arguments as task data, not shell code. Read the target repository instructions. Preserve the requested scope and existing authorizations.

Build the requested surface in its owning worktree. Report actual build and test exit status, generated artifacts, and unresolved references. A missing test target and a failing test are different outcomes. Use the skill for process ownership and build isolation.
